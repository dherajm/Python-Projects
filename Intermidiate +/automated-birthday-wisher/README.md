Hello everyone,

Firstly modify the 'birthdays.csv' file based on your requirements or you can add your own .csv file which contains (Name, Day, Month, Email ID) of the people you want to automate your birthday wish.

Secondly, you can see a YouTube video to learn how to set App-Password for your Email ID.

Lastly, to completely automate this code, you will have to hoist the code on Cloud.

Follow the instructions below to successfully automate your code.
- Visit 'https://www.pythonanywhere.com' and Sign In or Create an account.
- Go to the 'Files' tab and upload your project files (__init__.py and birthdays.csv).
- Next go to the 'Tasks' tab and 
  1. Set the time in UTC.
  2. In the command section type 'python3 __init__.py'
  3. Finally, create the task.

After following the above tasks, you will have your Automated Birthday Wisher code run every single day on the allotted time.

And there you go you have completely automated your code.
